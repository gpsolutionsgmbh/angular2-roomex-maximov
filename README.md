## Development server
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests (implemented only for search results component).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests (only single tests to check whether app-wide title is rendered on the page).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.
